# ScrollView

Show a part of view with scrollbar. 
The `ScrollView` can show an arbitrary content view inside it. It is used to make
any View scrollable. When the content is larger than the `ScrollView`,
scrollbars will be optionally showed. When the content view is smaller
then the `ScrollView`, the content view will be resized to the size of the
`ScrollView`.
The scrollview supports keyboard UI and mousewheel.
It extends [`BaseView`](base-view.md).

## Class: ScrollView extends `BaseView`

> Create and control scroll views.

### Example

```javascript
// In the main process.
const path = require("path");
const { app, BrowserView, BaseWindow, ContainerView, ScrollView, WrapperBrowserView } = require("electron");

const WEBVIEW_WIDTH = 600;
const GAP = 30;
const URLS = [
  "https://theverge.com/",
  "https://mashable.com",
  "https://www.businessinsider.com",
  "https://wired.com",
  "https://macrumors.com",
  "https://gizmodo.com",
  "https://maps.google.com/",
  "https://sheets.google.com/",
];

global.win = null;

app.whenReady().then(() => {
  win = new BaseWindow({ autoHideMenuBar: true, width: 1400, height: 700 });

  // The content view.
  const contentView = new ContainerView();
  contentView.setBackgroundColor("#1F2937");
  win.setContentBaseView(contentView);
  contentView.setBounds({x: 0, y: 0, width: 1378, height: 600});

  // Scroll
  const scroll = new ScrollView();
  scroll.setHorizontalScrollBarMode("enabled");
  scroll.setVerticalScrollBarMode("disabled");
  contentView.addChildView(scroll);
  scroll.setBounds({x: 0, y: 0, width: 1377, height: 600});

  // Scroll content
  const scrollContent = new ContainerView();
  scroll.setContentView(scrollContent);
  scrollContent.setBounds({x: 0, y: 0, width: URLS.length * (WEBVIEW_WIDTH + GAP), height: 600});

  for (var i = 1; i <= URLS.length; i++) {
    const browserView = new BrowserView();
    browserView.setBackgroundColor("#ffffff");
    const wrapperBrowserView = new WrapperBrowserView({ 'browserView': browserView });
    const webContentView = new ContainerView();
    webContentView.addChildView(wrapperBrowserView);
    wrapperBrowserView.setBounds({x: 0, y: 0, width: 600, height: 540});
    scrollContent.addChildView(webContentView);
    webContentView.setBounds({x: i*(WEBVIEW_WIDTH + GAP)+GAP, y: 30, width: 600, height: 540});
    browserView.webContents.loadURL(URLS[i-1]);
  }
});
```

### `new ScrollView([options])` _Experimental_

* `options` Object (optional)
  * `horizontalScrollBarMode` string (optional) - Can be `disabled`, `enabled-but-hidden`, `enabled`. Default is `enabled`.
  * `verticalScrollBarMode` string (optional) - Can be `disabled`, `enabled-but-hidden`, `enabled`. Default is `enabled`.

Creates the new scroll view.

### Instance Events

Objects created with `new ScrollView` emit the following events:

#### Event: 'did-scroll' _macOS_ _Experimental_

Returns:

* `event` Event

Emitted when the content view is being scrolled.

#### Event: 'will-start-live-scroll' _macOS_ _Experimental_

Returns:

* `event` Event

Emitted at the beginning of user-initiated live scroll tracking (gesture scroll or scroller tracking, for example, thumb dragging).

#### Event: 'did-live-scroll' _macOS_ _Experimental_

Returns:

* `event` Event

Emitted after changing the clipview bounds origin due to a user-initiated event.

#### Event: 'did-end-live-scroll' _macOS_ _Experimental_

Returns:

* `event` Event

Emitted at the end of live scroll tracking.

#### Event: 'scroll-wheel' _macOS_ _Experimental_

Returns:

* `event` Event
* `mouseEvent` boolean - Set to `true` if generated by the mouse.
* `scrollingDeltaX` Float - The scroll wheel’s horizontal delta.
* `scrollingDeltaY` Float - The scroll wheel’s vertical delta.
* `phase` string - The phase of a gesture event.
* `momentumPhase` string - The momentum phase for a scroll or flick gesture.

Emitted when the mouse’s scroll wheel has moved.

 Both `phase` and `momentumPhase` can be one of the following values:
* `none` - The event is not associated with a phase.
* `began` - An event phase has begun.
* `stationary` - An event phase is in progress but hasn't moved since the previous event.
* `changed` - An event phase has changed.
* `ended` - The event phase ended.
* `cancelled` - The system canceled the event phase.
* `mayBegin` - The system event phase may begin.

A gesture phase corresponds to a fluid gesture event. As a gesture event occurs,
its phase begins with `began` and ends with either `ended` or `canceled`.
All the gesture events are sent to the view under the cursor when the `began` occurred.
Technically, a gesture scroll event starts with a `began` phase and ends with a
`ended`. However, when the user puts two fingers down on a trackpad, the
trackpad issues `mayBegin`, followed by `began`, `cancelled`, or `ended`.
The `mayBegin` event phase signals that scrolling is about to begin before the
gesture has technically started. A Magic Mouse does not issue `mayBegin` scroll
wheel events.
Legacy scroll wheel events (say from a Mighty Mouse) and momentum scroll wheel
events both have a phase of `none`. (Legacy scroll wheel events also have
a `momentumPhase` of `none`.)

The `momentumPhase` helps you detect momentum scrolling, in which the hardware
continues to issue scroll wheel events even though the user is no longer
physically scrolling. Devices such as Magic Mouse and Multi-Touch trackpad
enable momentum scrolling.
During non momentum scrolling, each `scroll-wheel` event is routed to the view
that is beneath the pointer for that event. In non momentum `scroll-wheel`
events, `momentumPhase` has the value `none`.
During momentum scrolling, each `scroll-wheel` event is routed to the view
that was beneath the pointer when momentum scrolling started. In momentum
`scroll-wheel` events, phase has the value `none`. When the device switches
from user-performed scroll events to momentum scroll wheel events,
`momentumPhase` is set to `began`. For subsequent momentum scroll wheel events,
`momentumPhase` is set to `changed` until the momentum subsides, or the user
stops the momentum scrolling; the final momentum scroll wheel event has a
`momentumPhase` value of `ended`.

It’s important to understand how the difference in the event-routing behavior
can affect the events you receive, depending on the scrolling device users are
using. When using a Multi-Touch trackpad, users must physically stop scrolling
before they can move the pointer, so you won’t receive any mouse-movement
events during a scroll. In contrast, a Magic Mouse lets users move
the pointer and click in the middle of a scroll. Because a scroll doesn’t end
until the user lifts their finger, any additional movement by a finger resting
on a Magic Mouse is still considered to be part of the original scroll, which
means that the event’s phase property is `changed` and not `began`, as you
might expect. If you process `scroll-wheel` events directly, be prepared to
receive mouse-movement events (such as `leftMouseDown`, `rightMouseDragged`,
and `otherMouseUp`) between `began` and `ended` when a Magic Mouse is in use.

#### `ScrollView.fromId(id)`

* `id` Integer

Returns `ScrollView | null` - The scroll view with the given `id`.

### Instance Methods

* `disabled` - The scrollbar is hidden, and the pane will not respond to e.g. mousewheel events even if the contents are larger than the viewport.
* `enabled-but-hidden` - The scrollbar is hidden whether or not the contents are larger than the viewport, but the pane will respond to scroll events.
*`enabled` - The scrollbar will be visible if the contents are larger than the viewport and the pane will respond to scroll events.

or the vertical scroller is hidden and the horizontal scroller is visible.

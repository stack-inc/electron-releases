with `clickThrough = true` will still display but won't receive any mouse events.

### Instance Methods

Objects created with `new BaseView` have the following instance methods:

#### `view.setBounds(bounds[, options])` _Experimental_

Resizes and moves the view to the supplied bounds relative to its parent.
In case one of the values : `duration`, `timingFunction`, `timingControlPoints` is specified, the resizing / moving is animated.

It's possible to specify a function that defines the pacing of an animation as a timing curve. 
The function maps an input time normalized to the range [0,1] to an output time also in the range [0,1].
You can specify a media timing function by supplying your own cubic Bézier curve control points using the `timingControlPoints` options or by using one of the predefined timing functions.

You can configure the timing function with the predefined timing function specified by name:
* `linear` - Linear pacing, which causes an animation to occur evenly over its duration
* `easeIn` - Ease-in pacing, which causes an animation to begin slowly and then speed up as it progresses
* `easeOut` - Ease-out pacing, which causes an animation to begin quickly and then slow as it progresses
* `easeInEaseOut` - Ease-in-ease-out pacing, which causes an animation to begin slowly, accelerate through the middle of its duration, and then slow again before completing
* `default` - Similar to 3t^2 - 2t^3, one of the basic Hermite blending functions.

When you supply your own cubic Bézier curve control points, then the function is modeled as a cubic Bézier curve.
The end points of the Bézier curve are automatically set to (0.0,0.0) and (1.0,1.0). The control points defining the Bézier curve are: [(0.0,0.0), (c1x,c1y), (c2x,c2y), (1.0,1.0)].
